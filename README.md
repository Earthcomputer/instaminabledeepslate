# Instaminable Deepslate

This mod lets you instamine deepslate with a netherite pickaxe + efficiency 5 + haste 2. Thank you for your attention.

## Wait, why doesn't it work?

You need to install it.

### It still doesn't work

Install it on the server AND the client. With Fabric. On 1.18.2. If you're on 1.19+ try installing Fabric API too.

### I want to be able to instamine obsidian with netherite

You can use a datapack, add obsidian to the `data/instaminabledeepslate/tags/blocks/netherite_instaminable.json`.

### I'm on 1.8.9

No. Also deepslate and netherite didn't exist.
